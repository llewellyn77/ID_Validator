## Overview

Each of these tests plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of the API. By covering a range of scenarios, these tests contribute to a robust and trustworthy API implementation. Given that this API tests a panic response, we need to ensure that response is received within the expected time frame to effectively evaluate the system's ability to provide timely assistance and support during critical situations. This is crucial for assessing the API's responsiveness and its potential to deliver prompt help in panic-related scenarios, ultimately contributing to the overall reliability and effectiveness of the panic response system.

  

## Tools

Language - Python 3.7.9

Testing Library - Pytest (refer to the requirements.txt for the other libraries used and versions)

  

## Note

Some of these test cases assumes that a valid token is inputted so theres 2 tests(api_test and py_test) to check if a valid access token is received and if not you will be notified and if there is a valid token received then the pytest will be accurate for the all test cases

## Setup

* In order to run this application make sure you have python installed and a IDE(Visual Studio Code)
* Use the terminal to then create a virtual environment with this command 'python -m venv venv'
* You then need to go into the environment with this command 'venv\Scripts\activate'
* You then need to install the necessary requirements/libraries with 'pip install -r requirements.txt' within the environment
* You can now run the program.py file
* I have also included a .bat file to run this program , if these tests need to be run at certain times the ,bat file can be called in the task scheduler
 

## Security

In order to keep the credentials and passwords safe i have used a .env file which stores this information
